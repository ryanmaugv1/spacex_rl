# SpaceX Self-Landing Rockets ðŸš€

Repository containing self-landing SpaceX rockets (agents) of many varieties and complexity.

Also contains many fun, customisable and diverse example scenes with agents in action.

These agents and environments were all custom-made from scratch using Blender, Unity 2020 & ML-Agents.

## AGENTS

We currently have the following list of agents implemented:

- [x] **[SN-11]** Simple/base TVC-Only Controlled Agent.
- [ ] **[SN-12]** SN-11 With Fuel Limit.
- [ ] **[SN-13]** SN-12 With Cold Has Thrusters.
- [ ] **[SN-14]** SN-13 With Fins & Simulated Air Drag.
- [ ] **[SN-15]** SN-14 With Deployable Landinf Legs.
- [ ] **[STARSHIP]** SN-15 With First Stage Booster (Full Flight).

## ENVIRONMENTS

I've provided or will provide a plethora of different scenes/environments which can be used, such as:

- Earth Environment
  - Landing on ship.
  - Landing at boca chica landing zone.
  - Landing on sky scraper.
  - much more...
- Moon Environment

You can freely extend any of these environment and customise them to create unique test scenarios for the agents.
